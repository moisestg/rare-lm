First, I want to thank my supervisor, Prof.Thomas Hofmann, for allowing me to do my thesis in the Data Analytics laboratory. I am also thankful for his	early comments that helped steering the project in the right direction.
	
I would like to express my gratitude to Florian Schmidt and Paulina Grnarova for providing me such an interesting and challenging thesis topic. I further thank them for the insightful discussions that we had all along the project and for helping me proofreading this report.
  
I thank all my friends that made me think of Zurich as a second home.
  
Finally, I would like to thank my family and specially my parents. Without your unconditional support I would not be writing this thanking words in the first place.
